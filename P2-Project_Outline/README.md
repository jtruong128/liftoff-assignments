# Project Outline
This project will create an online food ordering website for my dream's Vietnamese restaurant that will allow customers to place an order for banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich), snacks and bowls. Customers can also view, change or cancel their orders. The website will allow customers to register their personal info such as email and password. Once they are register, they will be able to log in, and order their foods.

## Assignment Description
[Project Outline Assignment](https://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/modules/assignments/project-outline)

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This website will include both front-end and back-end components to store customer orders in a database. It contains the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions with the user login authentication.

### Features
The website will include three Features
(1) User authentication using identity framework available in ASP.NET Core 
(2) MySQL database will be used to persist customer order data
(3) ASP.NET Core ViewModel will be used to validate the information that customers enter on the order form

### Technologies
- C#
- ASP.NET Core MVC
- MySQL
- Razor View 
- Bootstrap
- HTML

### What I'll Have to Learn
For the login functionality, I'll have to learn something new in either scenario. If I choose to use native login functionality for the site, I'll need to learn how to use the login approach outlined in theÂ  course using ViewModel validation. If I choose to use the authentication framework, I'll need to learn how to use the ASP.NET Identity Authentication framework.
